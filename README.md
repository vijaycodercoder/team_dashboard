## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure (Simplified)

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ components/         # Reusable UI components (Navbar, MemberCard, etc.)
â”œâ”€â”€ Pages/              # Main page views (Dashboard)
â”œâ”€â”€ data/               # Mock data (members.ts)
â”œâ”€â”€ features/           # Redux slices (basicSlice.ts)
â”œâ”€â”€ App.tsx             # App entry point
â””â”€â”€ main.tsx            # ReactDOM bootstrap
```

## ðŸŒ™ Dark Mode Support

- Automatically applies dark theme based on system/browser settings.
- Users can toggle between **Light** and **Dark** mode via the toggle button in the navbar.
- Preference is saved in `localStorage`.
